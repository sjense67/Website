##Filtering Columns and Rows

In SQL one can filter columns and rows of a selected table. Columns can be filtered using the SELECT command and rows can be filtered using the WHERE command. Following is an example of this using the Lahman basaeball database.

Before the tables can be filtered, the Lahman and sqldf packages need to be loaded.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Here is an example of filters used in the Batting table of the Lahman database to look at the home run totals of the 1927 Yankees.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
